# MultifactorAuthentication
Multifactor Authentication with Face Detection, Email OTP and Encrypted Passwords using MERN stack.

"Multifactor Authentication with Face Detection, Email OTP, and Encrypted Passwords using MERN stack. This project leverages the Jimp library for face detection in user-uploaded images and utilizes an SMTP server to send one-time passwords via email. The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is used to build a web-based platform that implements multiple factors of authentication for enhanced security. The user's passwords are encrypted using hash algorithms to ensure confidentiality and protect against potential attacks. Overall, this project provides a robust and secure solution for multifactor authentication that is ideal for a variety of web applications."
